## Machine Learning

[Stars Categorization:](https://github.com/cristianBMJ/ProyectsDataScience/blob/main/classification-star.ipynb)   Classification of Star Giants  or  Dwarfs , consider the  [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vinesmsuic/star-categorization-giants-and-dwarfs). The categorization the Stars was studied according to criteria the Morgan–Keenan (MK) classification system. Firstly, the dataset was cleaned  and then it was balanced. In order to apply  three models's Machine Learning, being **Random Forest Classification**   the one with the better results, obtaining a precision of 93%.   


[Forecasting Store Sales:](https://github.com/cristianBMJ/ProjectsDataScience/blob/main/forecasting-store-salesPB.ipynb) Forecasting to determine Store Sales of Ecuador. The Stores are in locations in the country. The Model learning is the kind Hydrid, it be first model **RandomForestRegressor** while the second model is **LinearRegression**.(under build-up)   




[House Prices:](https://github.com/cristianBMJ/ProjectsDataScience/blob/main/forecasting-store-salesPB.ipynb) This project consist to implement Advance Tecnique Regression. For it, we applied a fork to notebook of Ryan Holbrook. In this new fork, we implemented more depth Exploratory Data Analysis. Additional, we agreeged new  models, with respect hypeterparameters, it was tuning,  used library **Optuna**.

[Discovering Explanets:](https://github.com/cristianBMJ/ProjectsDataScience/blob/main/forecasting-store-salesPB.ipynb) Problem of Classification the Explanets. I used the resource (). It was worked **Random Forest Classification**, findings hiperparameters with **RandomSearchCV**, achieve a 74,65% under metric ´f1´. In turn, displayed **Confusion Matrix**



## Deep Learning

[Petal of the Metal:](https://github.com/cristianBMJ/PortfolioDataScience/blob/main/petals-to-the-metal.ipynb) The present Machine learning model, consists to classify 104 types of flowers based on their images. For that, added news layers were implemented and transfer learning used pretrained apliccations **Xception** and **DenseNet201** to get a Hybric Model. The train it on a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU).
