# Projects of Data Science

## Machine Learning

[Stars Categorization:](https://github.com/cristianBMJ/ProyectsDataScience/blob/main/classification-star.ipynb)   Classification of Star Giants  or  Dwarfs , consider the  [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vinesmsuic/star-categorization-giants-and-dwarfs). The categorization the Stars was studied according to criteria the Morganâ€“Keenan (MK) classification system. Firstly, the dataset was cleaned  and then it was balanced. In order to apply  three models's Machine Learning, being **Random Forest Classification**   the one with the better results, obtaining a precision of 94% used metrics F1.   


[Forecasting Store Sales:](https://github.com/cristianBMJ/ProjectsDataScience/blob/main/forecasting-store-salesPB.ipynb) Forecasting to determine Store Sales of Ecuador. The Stores are in locations in the country. The Model learning is the kind Hydrid, it be first model **RandomForestRegressor** while the second model is **LinearRegression**.(under build-up)   




[House Prices:](https://github.com/cristianBMJ/ProjectsDataScience/blob/main/fork-of-houseprices.ipynb) This project consist to implement Advance Tecnique Regression. For it, we applied a fork to notebook of Ryan Holbrook. In this new fork, we implemented more depth Exploratory Data Analysis. Additional, we agreeged new  models, with respect hypeterparameters, it was tuning,  used library **Optuna**.

[Discovering Exoplanets:](https://github.com/cristianBMJ/ProjectsDataScience/blob/main/DiscoveryExoplanets.ipynb) Problem of Classification the Explanets. we  used the [source](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/API_kepcandidate_columns.html). It was worked **Random Forest Classification**, findings hiperparameters with **RandomSearchCV**, achieve a 74,65% for the metric **f1**. In turn, displayed **Confusion Matrix**

[Income:](https://github.com/cristianBMJ/ProjectsDataScience/blob/main/Ingresos.ipynb) The project is about determined Income for some Adults
, the target is divide in two interval, `<=50K` and `>50K`. Therefore,  it is problem of Classification. The Metric used is **F1** and **Confusion Matrix**, to obtaing a precision aproximately of '81%'.    

## Deep Learning

[Emojis:](https://github.com/cristianBMJ/ProjectsDataScience/blob/main/objectoLocalization.ipynb) In this project, the goal was determined Object Localization, correspond one Emojis. The problem consisted in  dectection  exactly only instance of one object. To do this, we trained a model with **Convolutional Neural Network** (CNN), utilized for it, library **TensorFlow**. The project  comes from Guided Project of Coursera.


[Petal of the Metal:](https://github.com/cristianBMJ/PortfolioDataScience/blob/main/petals-to-the-metal.ipynb) The present Machine learning model, consists to classify 104 types of flowers based on their images. For that, added news layers were implemented and transfer learning used pretrained apliccations **Xception** and **DenseNet201** to get a Hybric Model. The train it on a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU).
